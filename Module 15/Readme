# Earthquake Visualization Project

## Overview

This project visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. The application plots earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude, with marker sizes reflecting the magnitude and colors indicating the depth of each earthquake.

## Features

- **Real-time Earthquake Data**: Fetches the latest earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
- **Interactive Map**: Users can interact with the map, zooming in and out to see earthquakes worldwide.
- **Magnitude and Depth Indicators**: Earthquake markers vary in size based on their magnitude and color based on their depth, providing visual insights into the nature of each earthquake.
- **Detailed Information on Click**: Clicking on an earthquake marker displays a popup with detailed information, including magnitude, location, and depth.
- **Customizable Map Views**: Includes base layers for different map styles (e.g., street, topographic, grayscale) that users can switch between.
- **Legend**: A legend explains the color scale used for earthquake depths.

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for interactive maps
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for fetching and processing GeoJSON data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Access to the internet to fetch earthquake data and map tiles

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the project.

## Usage

- The map will automatically load with the latest earthquake data plotted.
- Use the mouse to navigate the map, zoom in and out, and click on markers for more details.
- Switch between different base map styles using the controls in the top right corner of the map.
- Refer to the legend in the bottom right corner to understand the color scale for earthquake depths.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for providing open access to earthquake data.
- Leaflet and D3.js communities for the excellent documentation and resources.
